    .SYNOPSIS
    Run to check whether a record is withing the specified threshold or not.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Use this function to determine if a record's last seen date is within a customer provided stale threshold parameter.  Will return a true or false value.

    .PARAMETER StaleThreshold
    Mandatory. Integer that represents how many days of data to check against the provided last seen date.

    .PARAMETER LastSeen
    Mandatory. Date for the record when it was last seen.
